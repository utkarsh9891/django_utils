# django_utils
Django utility functions and libraries that I have written over time and regularly use.


Hola,  
I would be updating and properly documenting this in a few days. Keep watching this repo for updates.  
Do note that there might be a few bugs in here due to the code snippets having been copied from several different projects. Would try to make this as generic as possible so that it can be used as-is in all django applications.
